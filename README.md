The software here continuously ingests data from the TextIT cloud service. TextIT administers surveys through cell phones to farmers in Zambia and Kenya. The data are collected at the TextIT server.  These tools pull down the data, minimally process it, and drop it into a MongoDB database. The data are then available for monitoring, visualization, and integration with local sensor data from PulsePod sensors being developed at Princeton.   This work funded in part under grants from the National Science Foundation BCS 1026776 and SES 1360463.
